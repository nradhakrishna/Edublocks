A decentralised system certificate storage system that uses ethereum and ipfs. 
In this system, the student can request for certificates via writing the request into college's blockchain. And inturn the college will store the certificate in ipfs storage which is decentralised in nature and write the certificate hash to the students blockchain.
The hash can only be seen by the student, the certificate can be retrieved from the hash.
If a recruiter wants to verify the certificates of the student, the student can ask the college to write the certificate hash into the recruiter's blockchain. This way the recruiter can be sure that the certificates are not tampered with because they are coming from the college itself.
